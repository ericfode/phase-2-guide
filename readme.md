## How This Phase Works

### Mornings
Monday - Thursday at 9 AM we meet in the meadow for standup or lecture. Friday, we
meet immediately after check-in.

Teams are encouraged to prepare their afternoon [lightning
talk](#lightningtalks) during the morning. Teams without an afternoon lightning
talk are encouraged to continue to work on their [group project](#grouprojects).

### Afternoons
Monday - Friday at 2 PM we meet in the cave for lightning talks. Lightning talks
are ~5 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes for discussion.

After lightning talks, teams are encouraged to work on group projects until 7pm.
Thereafter you should all pursue [side projects](#sideprojects).

## Group Projects
Group projects are only to be worked on until 6~7pm. You will not 'finish' your
group project. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. This is why there is a 7PM hard
stop.

## Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are 5 minutes where you answer a given question. By restricting
it to 5 minutes, you must choose the most important things to talk about.
Generally the best lightning talks is 1 idea, split into 2~3 parts. Any more
parts and it gets rushed or too high level.

Lightning talks use a whiteboard. No projector allowed! Feel free to practice
sketching before giving the talk.

Every single person will be giving at least 1 talk, and most will do 2. Once you
have done 1 talk, you cannot do another talk until everyone else has done 1
talk. Once you have done 2, you cannot do another talk until everyone else has
done 2. The same for 3 and 4 if we get to do that many.
