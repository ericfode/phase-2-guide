## How This Phase Works

### Mornings
Monday - Thursday at 9 AM we meet in the meadow for standup or lecture. Friday, we
meet immediately after check-in.

Teams are encouraged to prepare their afternoon [lightning
talk](/lightning_talks) during the morning. Teams without an afternoon lightning
talk are encouraged to continue to work on their group project. Once you have
done a lightning talk, you cannot do another one until everyone on your team has
done a lightning talk.

### Afternoons
Monday - Friday at 2 PM we meet in the cave for lightning talks. Lightning talks
are ~5 minutes long, followed by 5 minutes for discussion.

After lightning talks, teams are encouraged to work on group projects until 7pm.
Thereafter you should all pursue [side projects](/side_projects).
